SHORT TERM

    Torification of the crawler
    Full check of seloger_listing_crawler.py
    Re-crawl


MID TERM

    Addition of the ad_crawler next to the current listing_crawler

    Small t-sne demo on the iris dataset

    Creation of map of Paris in a d3 block. [Done]

    Why are len(ads) and n_results different at the end of the crawl?
        Is this really because of the ban?
        Check that links are not inserted twice?


LONG TERM

    In the end maybe we could have a crawler for each website in a different class.
        The 3 main sites are seloger.com, immostreet.com and explorimmo.com.
    Create maps of Paris with the prices per area.
    Try to visualize the shapes of the correlations between prices/nb_of_rooms/area etc.
    Display the variance in prices depending on the location.
    Use nltk to see if a different vocabulary is used depending on whether it's an expensive appartment or not.
    Use k-mean, t-sne and co. to cluster the ads together.
    Figure out what are the most important features that determine the price, etc.
    Try to come up with a strategy to find the best appartment given certain conditions.
        Ex: I'm looking for an appartment like whatever, which one is the best?
