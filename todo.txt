STRUCTURE:
    histograms
        The 2 histograms of prices (?)
            - to show the trend when we get to luxurious appartements
            - to show that people like round number
            And a picture of the most expensive appartement with the eiffel tower for effect
        Try to visualize the shapes of the correlations between prices/nb_of_rooms/area etc.
    paris map
        Create maps of Paris with the prices per area.
        Display the variance in prices depending on the location.
        Just Area, Prices ...
    tsne (pca)
        With and without autoencoders?
        Depending on the representation
        Color depending on price, area, price per mÂ²
        Comments:
            JS implementation tested, need to add interaction (make viz move), not possible because quadratic, need to use Barnes-Hut in sklearn

========

DATA MINING

    Figure out what are the most important features that determine the price/location/etc.
    clustering, kmeans, hierachical methods
    outlier detections
    Dendrograms

    Torification of the crawler [kinda done ? need to be checked]
    Full check of seloger_listing_crawler.py and Re-crawl (?)

Why are len(ads) and n_results different at the end of the crawl?
    Is this really because of the ban?
    Check that links are not inserted twice?

Randomize pages access in the crawler

Long term:

Use nltk to see if a different vocabulary is used depending on whether it's an expensive appartment or not. (???)

In the end maybe we could have a crawler for each website in a different class.
The 3 main sites are seloger.com, immostreet.com and explorimmo.com.

Try to come up with a strategy to find the best appartment given certain conditions.
    Ex: I'm looking for an appartment like whatever, which one is the best?
